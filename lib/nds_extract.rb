# MY OWN NOTE! OPEN PREVIOUS LAB AND LOOK AT HOW I ACCESSED THE VALUES USING KEYS INSTEAD OF NUMBERS LIKE IN THE EXAMPLES TO THE LEFT. YOU NEED TO SHOVEL INTO directorHash THE NAME OF THE DIRECTOR AS A KEY AND THE TOTAL THEIR MOVIES MADE AS THE VALUE. THEN ADD IT ALL UP TO A GRAND TOTAL IN THE END. STILL USE THE EXAMPLE TO THE LEFT AS A FOUNDATION FOR YOUR METHOD, THOUGH. IT'S NOT AS COMPLICATED AS YOU THINK IT IS!
